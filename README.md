# Perez Portfolio
Hello! My name is Eddie Perez and I'm a third year Computer Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science. This repository contains a collection of code that I have worked on as part of class assignments or projects.

All code is found within folders denoting the semester in which the code had been created, which then contain folders that each have README files detailing how to compile and run the code, the code itself, and example input files when necessary.
